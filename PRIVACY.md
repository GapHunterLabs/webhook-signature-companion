# Privacy Policy — Webhook Signature Companion

**Effective date:** 2026-10-06

Webhook Signature Companion is a Gap Hunter Labs plugin for IntelliJ
Platform IDEs. This policy is short because the plugin's design makes
it short: there is nothing to disclose beyond what's below.

## What this plugin collects

**Nothing.** Webhook Signature Companion does not collect, transmit, or sell any data — no source code, no file contents, no file
paths, no usage analytics, no telemetry, no crash reports, no personally
identifiable information. Your open file's PSI is read only in memory
for as long as the IDE is open.

## What it keeps on your machine

To decide when to show its one-time rating prompt, the plugin keeps two values
in the IDE's own settings on your computer: whether you have answered the
prompt, and a list of up to 500 findings it has already counted. Until the
next release, each entry in that list is the file path and line of a finding,
sometimes with its message. From the next release on, each entry is a one-way
fingerprint that cannot be turned back into a path, and the old list is
deleted. None of this is ever sent anywhere.

## Network access

**None.** Webhook Signature Companion makes zero network calls during
normal operation.

## Third parties

None. Webhook Signature Companion has no third-party SDKs, no analytics
libraries, no ad networks, no external dependencies that phone home.

## Changes to this policy

If this ever changes, this file will be updated and the change will be
noted in the plugin's `CHANGELOG.md`.
